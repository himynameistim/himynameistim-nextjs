        <h2>Tim Griffiths</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Hi my name is Tim</b>, and I am Director of Sitecore
          Development at Lab, a Digital Agency in the UK. I am also a
          developer with many years experience specialising in ASP.NET
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of my main job I created Training Buddy a fitness tracking
          app for Windows Phone, which in it's time topped the Health
          and Fitness category on the app store.
        </p>
        <h2>What&amp;s with the toy pictures?</h2>
        <p>
          Quite simply websites with pictures have higher engagement rates,
          so if you want to create an engaging website you need pictures. If
          the content of your website is largely code examples or articles
          on backend tech then this creates a bit of an issue. There's
          nothing to take a photo of and there's only so many times you
          can have pictures of code that have been made to look a little
          artsy.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          So, I wanted something that's fun that I hadn't seen on other
          peoples blogs and decided on toys. At times they can be relevant,
          like a toy screaming or lego representing building blocks, but at
          worst there still a fun non-offensive lighthearted picture.
        </p>
        <h2>Awards</h2>
        <p>

          running from 2017 - 2021 and Sitecore Ambassador MVP in 2022.
